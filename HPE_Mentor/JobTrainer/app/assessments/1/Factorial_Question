## Factorial of a Number

>Write a  function to calculate the factorial of a given positive integer n. The factorial of a number n is the product of all positive integers from 1 to n. For example, the factorial of 5 is 5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120.

>Your task is to create a function calculateFactorial that takes an integer n as its parameter and returns the factorial of n.


### Constraints

- The input integer n will be a positive integer (0 <= n <= 12).

### Example

Example 1:

>Input: n = 5

>Output: 120

>Explanation: The factorial of 5 is 5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120.


### Note

- For input n = 5, the function should return 5! = 120 as explained above.

- For input n = 0, the function should return 1 since the factorial of 0 is defined to be 1.

- For input n = 10, the function should return 10! = 3628800.
